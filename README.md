# Exchange Tracker

A Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript Progressive Web App (PWA) that tracks exchange rates, stores historical data in Firebase Firestore, and sends alerts via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

This repository contains two main parts:

- `frontend/` - Vue 3 app (Pinia, Tailwind, Vite, TypeScript)
- `functions/` - Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js) for scheduled rate updates and alert notifications

See `frontend/README.md` and `functions/README.md` for per-directory setup steps.
